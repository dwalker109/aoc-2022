# Advent of Code 2022!

Rust, again. Maybe I will try to avoid crates.io this time?

## Notes

### Day 11

Part 2 required some maths knowledge with I don't posess - greatest common divisor. 
I needed to look at hints to progress.

### Day 16

Quite a challenge. I obtained star 2 trying a super stupid solution I really didn't
think would work, which I read about on the subreddit. It worked, but not
on the test data. 

I went back and rewrote this to use something more correct. It now completes in 
a *reasonable* time (5 secs) and works on test and real input. Happy enough to move on.

### Day 17

Completed part 2 with much frustration. I used lots of subreddit hints for this
day, but finally understand who the cycle detection and skipping works.

### Day 21

My initial solution was incredibly slow, since it involves loads of message passing 
and so on. My part 2 was semi-manually brute forced. Subreddit hints clued me
in on the maths involved (simple algebra, really) and I replaced the message
passing stuff with recursive calls which I'm ultimately pretty pleased with.

...**Time Passes**...

### Day 19

Back to complete AoC 2022 after about 11 months away. Day 19 was a challenge and 
I needed hints from the subreddit to learn the optimisation tricks (factory, not time)
to get a decent time. Lots of weirdness but eventually finished.
