# Advent of Code 2022!

Rust, again. Maybe I will try to avoid crates.io this time?

## Notes

### Day 11

Part 2 required some maths knowledge with I don't posess - greatest common divisor. 
I needed to look at hints to progress.

### Day 16

Quite a challenge. I obtained star 2 trying a super stupid solution I really didn't
think would work, which I read about on the subreddit. It worked, but not
on the test data. ~I still need to finish this day properly.~

Day 16 now completes in a *reasonable* time (5 secs) and works on test and real 
input. Happy enough to move on.

### Day 17

Part 2 needs to be finished.

### Day 21

My solution was incredibly slow, since it involves loads of message passing 
and so on. My part 2 was semi-manually brute forced. Suffice to say, I want to
go back to this one - I have the maths required now from reading the subreddit
and would like to implement.
